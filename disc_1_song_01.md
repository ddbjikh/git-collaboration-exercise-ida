Ooooohhh
dofi By Miami Beach
B.U.S.E.
Didn't get to bed last night

On the way to Paper Bank
was on my knee
May I have a travel flight

I'm back in the USSR
You know how lucky you are, boy
back in the USSR

Be on ways on long holidays
you knew to place
Jeez could to be by home?
Live until tomorrow
to unpack my case
honey, does collect the phone

I'm back in the USSR
You know how lucky you are, boy
back in the US
back in the US
back in the USSR

all these girls really knock me out
I leave the west behind

and moscow girls make me sing and shout
oh come on

I'm back in the USSR
You know how lucky you are, boy
back in the USSR

all these girls really knock me out
leave the west behind

Show me around these snowy mountains
Take me to your dad and mom

I'm back in the USSR
You know how lucky you are, boy
back in the USSR

Let me tell you how
